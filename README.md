**Front-end Development Challenge**

Created a webpage that displays a list of books with their title, author,
and a checkbox to indicate if you've read the book or not. The list of books
should be stored in an array of objects, where each object represents a book
with the following properties: `title`, `author`, and `read`.
The `read` property should be a boolean value that indicates whether the book
has been read or not.

The webpage should have a form to add new books to the list. The form should
give the user options to enter the required fields of the book (title, author,
read/not read). When the form is submitted, a new book should be added to
the array of books and displayed on the webpage.

**Webpage includes:**
1. The HTML structure of the webpage
2. The JavaScript code that implements the following:
• The array of books
• DOM manipulation to display the list of books
• The form to add new books
• The event listener for the form submission that adds new books to
the array and displays them on the webpage

**Additional requirements:**

• Used the object concept in JavaScript to create a `Book` object that
initializes a new book object with the `title`, `author`, and `read`
properties.

• Used DOM manipulation methods to create and append new elements
to the webpage.
• Used event listeners to handle form submissions and checkbox
changes.
